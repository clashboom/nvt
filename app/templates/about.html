          <h5>Founding the Company</h5>
          <p>Navette is founded in Norway. The company is born out of an idea to design and manufacture pleasure boats. Initially there are 3 founders, but later Rune Nilsen buys all shares.</p>

          <p>Production is outsourced to a Latvian company with a goal to cut costs while maintaining the quality. This would result in lowered prices and therefore product being more available to the customer.</p>

          <p>To ensure quality control Navette expands its operations to Latvia - estabilishing a production facility in Saldus. The facility is small but for now - satisfactory.</p>
