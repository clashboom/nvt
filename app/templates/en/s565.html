{% set page_title = 'Navette S 565 - Fast and comfortable console boat with great ride characteristics' %}

{% block description_text_one %}
        S 565 combines advantages of <span class="translate">Jeep</span> and bowrider. The boat has <span class="translate">Jeepens enkle bruksegenskaper</span> and bowriders protection from weather.

The boat has been developed with an emphasis on ergonomics. It is easy to move around in and the seating is comfortable. In the front there is easily enough room for 2-3 adults, while up to six persons can be seated around a table. The cockpit is among the absolute best. The driver can be seated or standing and still have a good overview of both panel and water. Steering wheel and gas / trim sits right where they should be. There is plenty of room for your legs and knees under the steering console. Under the rear seat there is a spacious storage compartment and under the control console - room for fish box, cooler, life jackets, etc. There is also a storage compartment for long items such as fishing rods or water skis. The boat is naturally self-bailing, even with seven persons on board. The windshield provides good protection behind the control console. The hull has a relatively deep V-bottom which ensures comfortable ride even in rough waters. <span class="translate"> Det er håndopplagt med triaksial duk i skroget. Hekken er spesielt kraftig da motorfundamentet er trukket noe bak hekken og forsterket direkte i langsgående stringere. Båten lander mykt i sjøen, hekken slipper ikke og det er bortimot umulig å kavitere propellen.

There is gate with sturdy boarding ladder in the rear and sidegate on the port side for easy boarding. Large windshield, thoughtfully organized ergonomic cockpit, canopy behind windshield with room for 6 people, sunbed or seats for up to 6 persons in the bow, large storage compartments with room for seat cushions, coolers, fishing rods, life jackets, water skis etc.

{% block quality_description %}
Only high quality gelcoat and GRP materials were used in production, ensuring great physical properties and resistance to water. Therefore you dont have to worry about things like osmosis. The composite layers of both hull and superstructure includes stitched triaxial fiberglass mat, which allows for excellent strength-to-weight ratio. All on-board equipment is of high quality. All fittings and accessories are made from corrosion resistant materials.
