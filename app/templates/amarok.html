  <h2>Description</h2>
We have designed a hardtop for the Amarok which uses the excact design elements from the car. This make the car look more like a station wagon.

Design elements
Bottomof hardtop followslightline in car.
Side panels in same shape as oncar
Integrated spoiler
Roofshape is the same as car
Rather straigt aft profile to undermine the purpose of the car.
Same width of hardtop as car
Side hatch opens with built ir handles


  Benefits (?) 
The hardtop makes noextrawind-noise
Largervolume
Brings Larger volume
Side hatchlarger and lower
No extrakeys for sidehatches.

Navette hardtops are constructed using multi- layer laminated glass fiber mats. The UV-resistant surface is made of durable, very robust Gelcoat.
The painting process uses the most modern knowledge of surface treatment and the latest European regulations.
